# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
I designed a relatively simple code in R to analyze the content of Twitter posts by using the categories identified as positive, negative and neutral. The code evaluates tweets based on the number of positive, negative and neutral words in the tweet.  *The words in the tweet correspond with the words in dictionaries (Downloaded from Internet) that you can find on the internet, but you can create a list yourself. It is also possible to edit this list or dictionary. Great work, but I discovered some issue.
